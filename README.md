# Project Description/Outline

The scope of this project is to review United States’ housing data since the housing market collapsed in 2008 and identify how the market has or has not rebounded between then and 2018 nationally. 
Key things we will analyze nationally and by state may include but are not limited to the following: 

* Average housing prices homeowner income data
* Student loan debt data by state
* Unemployment data by state
* Homeowner debt ratios by state 

We will identify which states have done the best and worst over this period, specifically looking at the top five and bottom five states. Additionally, we will identify where homeowners may have a higher barrier to buying a home by looking at prices versus debt to income ratios, household debt, etc.. 
The purpose of this will be to see what relationships there may be between increasing housing prices with homeowner incomes, housing prices and unemployment, as well as where within the United States is the “best” to live (e.g., affordable homes, higher incomes, low unemployment). 

## Research Questions to Answer
What areas in the US have on average the most/least affordable homes between 2008 - 2018? 
What areas in the US have experienced the highest increase/decrease in housing prices between 2008 - 2018?
Are things such as debt (e.g., homeowner, student loan), homeowner incomes, and unemployment directly correlated to states that have most/least affordable homes between 2008 - 2018?
What may the housing market look like in the next couple years based on our findings?
